# Tic-Tac-Toe Program for Python
Simple Python program where one can play the game tic-tac-toe against another human player or against an AI player.

Future improvements could include integrating a GUI for the game (perhaps using tkinter), further refining the AI and better management of complexity with regard to both space and time.
